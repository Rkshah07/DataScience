📱 Google Play Store App Data Analysis
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset from the Google Play Store. The goal is to uncover insights about apps, their ratings, reviews, pricing, categories, and more — using Python, data visualization, and statistical testing.

🧠 Objectives
1. Most Popular Apps Based on User Engagement
Identified top 13 apps with the highest number of reviews.

Visualized using a colorful horizontal bar chart with value labels.

2. Most Competitive App Categories
Analyzed the top 10 categories based on the number of apps available.

Used a bar plot with vibrant hues to highlight competition levels.

3. Content Suitability Distribution
Visualized the distribution of content ratings across apps using:

📊 Pie Chart

🍩 Donut Chart

Created with Plotly for interactive visuals.

4. Free vs Paid App Availability in Top Categories
Compared the number of free and paid apps within the top 10 categories.

Grouped bar charts were used for clear comparison.

5. App Ratings: Free vs Paid (Z-Test Analysis)
Conducted a statistical Z-Test to compare rating behavior between free and paid apps.

Conclusion drawn based on the p-value significance.

Boxplots created for visual comparison.

📌 Bonus Insights
✅ Reviews vs Rating by Category
Scatter plot illustrating how user reviews relate to ratings across different categories.

✅ Correlation Heatmap
Explored correlations between key numeric fields:
Rating, Reviews, Installs, Price.

🚨 Outlier Detection & Visualization
Used Interquartile Range (IQR) method to:

Detect extreme outliers in Reviews column.

Generate boxplots with and without outliers.

Printed summary statistics before and after cleaning.
